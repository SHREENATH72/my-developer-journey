# Linus Torvalds Tribute Website

A simple tribute website built using **HTML** to honor Linus Torvalds â€” the creator of Linux and Git.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

This is my very first web project created using only **HTML**. It includes:

- A short biography of Linus Torvalds
- Key achievements
- Navigation using anchor links
- An image with a caption
- Semantic HTML structure
